        <h2>What is the Tridentine Mass?</h2>
        <p>
            The <i>Tridentine</i> Mass, or formally called the <i>Tridentine rite</i>
            is the Latin Roman rite revised and established for all the Western Church
            by Pope St. Pius V after the Council of Trent (1545 - 1563).
        </p>

        <p>
            The word "<i>Tridentine</i>"" came from the Latin "<i>Tridentinus</i>",
            adjective from the name of the town of Trent, in Northern Italy.
        </p>

        <p>
            The Tridentine rite remains a deeply cherished liturgy celebrated
            in Latin according to the 1962 Missal of Pope St. John XXIII.
